This article explains basic steps of installing anvi'o using rather conventional methods.

Please consider opening an <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues">issue</a> for technical problems, or join us on Slack if you need help:

<span class="extra-info-header">A note on Chrome</span>

Currently, the [Chrome Web Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) has the most efficient SVG engine among all browsers we tested. For instance, Safari can run the anvi'o interactive interface, however it takes orders of magnitude more time and memory compared to Chrome. Firefox, on the other hand, doesn't even bother drawing anything at all. Long story short, the anvi'o interactive interface __will not perform optimally__ with anything but Chrome. So you need Chrome. Moreover, if Chrome is not your default browser, every time interactive interface pops up, you will need to copy-paste the address bar into a Chrome window. You can learn what is your default browser by running this command in your terminal:

``` bash
python -c 'import webbrowser as w; w.open_new("http://")'
```

</div>

## Painless installation with Homebrew

If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed on your computer, all you need to do is to run this to have anvi'o installed, and skip the rest of this page (although we suggest you to run `brew doctor` in your terminal first to make sure everything is good to go):

``` bash
brew tap merenlab/anvio
brew install merenlab/anvio/anvio
```

Once the installation is complete, test anvi'o quickly to make sure everything is in order:


``` bash
anvi-self-test --suite mini
```

That's it!

{:.notice}
You may see warning messages during self-test runs. Don't be concerned.


## Painless installation with Conda


If you have [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), it is also possible to install anvi'o along with its all Python and non-Python dependencies thanks to [John Eppley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4S2q_9cAAAAJ&hl=en):

``` bash
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge anvio diamond bwa
```

***Note***: Some users reported that the one above was installing anvio `v4`, if that is also the case for you, uninstall it, and try it with this command:

```
conda install -n anvio5 -c bioconda -c conda-forge anvio=5.1.0 diamond bwa
```

***Note***: One of our users who has been trying conda installation on an HPC system [reported](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/issues/895#issuecomment-403656800) the following steps working for them:

```
conda create -y --name anvio5 python=3.6
conda install -y --name anvio5 django=2.0.2
conda install -y --name anvio5 -c bioconda -c conda-forge anvio=5 diamond bwa
```

Once the installation is complete, test anvi'o quickly to make sure everything is in order:

``` bash
anvi-self-test --suite mini
```

{:.notice}
Note that the most up-to-date conda-available anvi'o version, which is currently `v5`, may differ from the most up-to-date stable anvi'o version, which is `v{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}`.


## Installation (with varying levels of pain)

First things first: nothing here is as scary as it looks, and you can do it.

Firs, you will need to make sure your system does have all the following software if you are going to follow any of the following installation instructions. If you just follow these links, you will most probably be golden:

* [samtools]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#samtools){:target="_blank"}
* [Prodigal]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#prodigal){:target="_blank"}
* [HMMER]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#hmmer){:target="_blank"}
* [SQLite]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#sqlite){:target="_blank"}
* [GSL]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#gnu-scientific-library){:target="_blank"}
* [HDF5]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-installing-third-party-software %}#hdf5){:target="_blank"}

Finally you will need `virtualenv`. This should work for most:

``` bash
pip install virtualenv
```

If you don't have `pip`, you will need to visit [this web page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to have it installed.

{:.notice}
**Please note**, anvi'o uses Python 3 exclusively.

{:.notice}
You may [run into some issues](https://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html) **eith `matplotlib` in the virtual environment**. A simple [solution](https://matplotlib.org/faq/osx_framework.html#short-version) is to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (which comes built-in in python 3) instead of `virtualenv`. 

If you run into any trouble, send an e-mail to [Google Groups for anvi'o](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anvio).

OK. If made through the section above, you may have gone through the most painful part already, and anvi'o developers are very proud of you.


### Installing the latest stable release (safe mode)

This is the best way to install the stable release (but not the best way if you would like to synchronize your anvi'o to the development version, for which you should jump to the 'active codebase' section).

You will do everything in a Python virtual environment. If you are not experienced with computer thingies, do not worry. If you have taken care of your dependencies mentioned above, the rest should be very simple.

We first need to create a new virtual environment for anvi'o. Since it is easier to keep all virtual environments in one place, I will first create a directory in my home:

``` bash
mkdir ~/virtual-envs/
```

Then we will create a new virtual environment for anvi'o under that directory, to activate it, and to check the Python version in it to make sure the version starts with `3`:

``` bash
virtualenv ~/virtual-envs/anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}
source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}/bin/activate
python --version
```

{:.notice}
If using venv, run `python3 -m venv ~/virtual-envs/anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}`

{:.notice}
The output of the last command must start with `Python 3`. If not, remove the virtual environment with `rm -rf ~/virtual-envs/anvio`, and find out how can you create a virtual environment for Python 3 on your system. You can try `-p python3` as a parameter to your `virtualenv` command. Or you can type `virtualenv` and _without pressing the space character_ press `TAB` key twice quickly to see if there is an alternative binary such as `virtualenv-3.5` or `virtualenv-3.5`. If not, it means Python 3 is not installed on your system.


Make sure your paths look alright. Yours should look similar to this:

``` bash
(anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}) meren ~ $ which pip
/Users/meren/virtual-envs/anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}/bin/pip
```

Now you can do the installation:

``` bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install cython
pip install anvio
```

If all looks good, now you should be able to run `anvi-self-test`:

``` bash
anvi-self-test --suite mini
```

{:.notice}
You may see warning messages during self-test runs. Don't be concerned.

If this runs successfully, a browser window will popup. Don't forget to go back to your terminal and press `CTRL+C` to kill the server. To leave the virtual environment, you can run the command `deactivate`.

Now every time you want to use anvi'o, you will need to activate the virtual environment. If you like things to be convenient as much as we do, you may want to run the following command so you have a new command, `anvi-activate` that activates your anvi'o installation:

``` bash
echo 'alias anvi-activate-v{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}="source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}/bin/activate"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

When I open a new terminal, things look like this:

``` bash
meren ~ $ anvi-interactive -v
-bash: anvi-interactive: command not found
meren ~ $ anvi-activate-v{% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}
(anvio) meren ~ $ anvi-interactive -v
Anvi'o version ...............................: {% include _project-anvio-version-number.html %}
Profile DB version ...........................: 20
Contigs DB version ...........................: 8
Pan DB version ...............................: 5
Samples information DB version ...............: 2
Genome data storage version ..................: 1
Auxiliary data storage version ...............: 3
Anvi'server users data storage version .......: 1
(anvio) meren ~ $ 
```

### Installing or updating from the active codebase (because why not)

This will allow you to go beyond the stable version and follow the very current version of the codebase (we assume you already have taken of your dependencies).

Let's setup a new virtual environment and activate it:

``` bash
virtualenv ~/virtual-envs/anvio-dev
source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-dev/bin/activate
python --version
```

Don't forget to make sure the output of the last command starts with `Python 3`.

### I need to get the codebase

So this is your first time with the codebase. Get a fresh copy (with all the submodules necessary):

``` bash
cd
git clone --recursive https://github.com/meren/anvio.git
```

Then go into the `anvio` directory, and then run the installation:

``` bash
cd anvio
source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-dev/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### I already have the codebase

So you want to _update_ your already existing installation. Follow these steps:

{% highlight bash %}
cd
cd anvio
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-dev/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}

### What now?

Now it is time to run `anvi-self-test --suite mini`, of course.

If you want to make things simpler, you can add an alias to your `~/.bash_profile` to easily switch to this environment:

``` bash
echo 'alias anvi-activate-dev="source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-dev/bin/activate"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

### Installation for developers (you're a wizard, arry)

{:.notice}
This is the best option to keep up-to-date with day-to-day updates from anvi'o developers.

If you are planning to do this, you really need no introductions, but I will give you one anyway. Clone the codebase into a `$DIR` you like:

{% highlight bash %}
cd $DIR
git clone --recursive https://github.com/meren/anvio.git
{% endhighlight %}

Create a virtual environment (`master` to remind you that you are following the GitHub `master`), and do the initial setup, and leave it:

``` bash
virtualenv ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master
source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate
python --version # make sure the output starts with `Python 3`.
cd $DIR/anvio # don't forget to update the $DIR with the real path
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build
cp build/lib.*/anvio/*so anvio/
rm -rf anvio.egg-info build dist
deactivate
```

Then update your activation batch to add necessary environment variables (keep in mind that **you need to update** the `$DIR` variable with whatever it shows in your system **before running the following lines in your terminal**):


``` bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$DIR/anvio/' >> ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$DIR/anvio/bin:$DIR/anvio/sandbox' >> ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$DIR/anvio/bin:$DIR/anvio/bin' >> ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate
```

That's it. If you like, add an alias to your `~/.bash_profile` to activate this quickly:

``` bash
echo 'alias anvi-activate-master="source ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Finally, if you would like to pull the latest commits from GitHub every time you switch to the `master`, add these to your activation batch (you will need to update `$DIR` once again):

``` bash
echo 'cd $DIR/anvio && git pull && cd -' >> ~/virtual-envs/anvio-master/bin/activate
```

You are golden.


## Running the "Mini Test"

You can make anvi'o test itself by running the program `anvi-self-test`. It is absolutely normal to see 'warning' messages. In most cases anvi'o is talkative, and would like to keep you informed. **You should read those warning messages carefully, but they often don't require any action.**

Upon the successful completion of all the tests, your browser should popup and take you to the interactive interface. When you click that 'Draw' button whenever you see one. One of those interfaces should look something like this (this is one of the older version of [the anvi'o interactive interface]({% post_url anvio/2016-02-27-the-anvio-interactive-interface %}), and it shall stay here so we remember where we came from):

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/misc/mini-test-screenshot.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/misc/mini-test-screenshot.png" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

All fine? Perfect! Now you have a running installation of anvi'o!

It is time to go through some anvi'o tutorials (see the pull-down menu at the top of this page), or take a look at [all the other posts on the platform]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio).
